                      In this chapter we study how to measure the ecological footprint per capita in every country.
                        First, we define the concept. Second, we provide an overview of the concepts ecological footprint
                        and biocapacity, Third, we present the methodology to work out the ecological footprint and the biocapacity.
                        Finally, we present the historical trends of the ecological footprint and the biocapacity.

            <h2>Ecological footprint and biocapacity. Definition</h2>

            The ecological footprint and the biocapacity are an account-based system of indicators whose underlying context is the recognition that
            Earth has a finite amount of biological production that supports all life on it. A widely recognized measure of sustainability,
            the Ecological Footprint provides an integrated,
            multiscale approach to tracking the use and overuse of natural resources, and the consequent impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity.

            </br>
            How much of the biosphere’s (or any region’s) regenerative capacity does human activity (“activities” can refer to
            the entire consumption metabolism of humanity, the consumption of a given population (such as a city), a production process,
            or something as small and discreet as producing 1 kilogram of durum wheat spaghetti) demand? <strong>How much of the planet’s (or a region’s)
            regenerative capacity does a defined activity require from nature?</strong>

                          <p class="text-right">The <strong>Ecological Footprint</strong> is derived by tracking how much biologically
                          productive area it takes to provide for all the competing demands of people.
                          These demands include space for food growing, fiber production, timber regeneration, absorption of
                          carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning, and accommodating built infrastructure.
                          A country’s consumption is calculated by adding imports to and subtracting exports from its national production.

                          All commodities carry with them an embedded amount of bioproductive land and sea area necessary to
                          produce them and sequester the associated waste. International trade flows can thus be seen as flows of

                          <p class="text-right"><strong>Biocapacity</strong> is measured by calculating the amount of biologically productive land and
                          sea area available to provide the resources a population consumes and to absorb its wastes, given current technology
                          and management practices. To make biocapacity comparable across space and time, <strong>areas are adjusted proportionally
                          to their biological productivity</strong>. These adjusted areas are expressed in “global hectares”.
                          Countries differ in the productivity of their ecosystems, and this is reflected in the Accounts.

                          Results from this analysis shed light on a country’s ecological impact. A country has an ecological reserve if its Footprint is smaller than its
                          biocapacity; otherwise it is operating with an ecological deficit. The former are often referred to as ecological creditors,
                          and the latter ecological debtors.
                            </br>

                          Today, most countries, and the world as a whole, are running ecological deficits. In fact, today <strong>over 85% of the world population
                          lives in countries with an ecological deficit</strong>. The world’s ecological deficit is referred to as global ecological overshoot.</p>

            <h2>National footprint and biocapacity accounts</h2>
            <p> National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts (NFAs) provide the core data required for all Ecological
                Footprint analysis worldwide.
                </br>
                </br>
                The Accounts measure the ecological resource use and resource capacity of nations over time. Based on approximately
                <strong>15,000 data points per country per year</strong>, the Accounts calculate the Footprints of more than 200 countries,
                territories, and regions from 1961 to the present.
                </br>
                </br>
                The calculations in the National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts are based on <strong>United Nations or UN affiliated data sets</strong>,
                including those published by the Food and Agriculture Organization, <strong>United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database</strong>,
                and the <strong>UN Statistics Division</strong>, as well as the <strong>International Energy Agency</strong>. Supplementary data sources include
                studies in peer-reviewed science journals and thematic collections. Of the countries, territories, and regions analyzed in the Accounts,
                150 had populations over one million and typically have more complete and reliable data sets. For most of those, Global Footprint Network
                is able to provide time series of both <strong>Ecological Footprint</strong> and <strong>biocapacity</strong>.

                        <strong>Ecological Footprint</strong> associated with a product or waste  (global hectares) is equal to:

            <p>For each land-use type, the <strong>Equivalence Factor</strong> is the ratio of a given land type’s average global productivity divided by the average
                global productivity of the entire planet’s productive surfaces. EQF makes it possible to compare the land used
                for a given product category with the average global bioproductive surface area, which may be of higher or lower average productivity.
                </br>
                </br>
                For each country, the Ecological Footprint of production of a single footprint category is
                calculated by <strong>summing all products of that footprint category</strong> (such as rice, wheat, corn for cropland).
                The total Ecological Footprint of production of a country is the sum of the Ecological Footprint of all product categories combined.

                Detailed equations and their application for each of the <strong>six Ecological Footprint subcomponents</strong>
                (cropland, grazing land, fishing grounds, forest for forest products, built-up land, and carbon footprint) can be found in
                (Lin et al., 2019). The next table introduces briefly those subcomponents.

                      The carbon Footprint represents the area of forest land required to sequester anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions.
                      The National Footprint Account workbook 2019 (NFA 2019) (Lin et al., 2019) calculates the Footprint of carbon dioxide emissions using
                      several parameters including domestic fossil fuel combustion and electricity use, embodied carbon in traded items and electricity,
                      a country’s share of global international transport emissions, and non-fossil-fuel sources.

                      </br>

                      The total amount of carbon dioxide allocated to each country is converted into global hectares based on the
                      <strong>Footprint intensity of carbon</strong>. This conversion factor is derived from the following:

                      <ul>
                            <li>the yield of the productive land that is required to absorb the carbon dioxide emissions</li>
                            <li>the amount of carbon absorbed by oceans</li>
                            <li>an equivalence factor for carbon as a land type</li>
                            <li>an adjustment factor for temporal changes in yield from the forest</li>
                      </ul>
                      </br>
                      The International Energy Agency (IEA) tracks carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion across 45 different economic sectors.
                    The IEA also publishes the total world emissions in international transport in the form of International Aviation bunker fuel and International
                    Marine bunker fuels which are aggregated to “international transport emissions.” These emissions are allocated to countries according to
                    their respective domestic fossil fuel combustion by the proportion of national to world imports. Emissions from cement are attributed to the
                    producing country; those from gas flaring emissions are distributed based on a country’s percentage of World fossil fuel consumption.

                  <p class="text-right">
                      The cropland Footprint reflects the amount of land necessary to grow all crops consumed by humans and livestock. This includes agricultural products,
                      market animal feed, and cropped grasses used as livestock feed.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      Cropland yields are calculated for each crop type by dividing the amount of crop produced by the amount of area harvested.
                      This differs from other land use types in that yields for cropland reflect an actual harvest yield, whereas other yields
                      are calculated based on regeneration rates. Harvest yields and regeneration rates for crops are equal by definition, as humans
                      manage all growth on cropland for harvest.

                  <p class="text-right">
                      The grazing land Footprint assesses demand for grazing land to feed livestock and the embodied demand for grazing land in traded goods.
                      This is the most logically complex section of NFA 2019. The calculations estimate the total feed requirements of all livestock produced and
                      the percentage of livestock energy requirements derived from concentrate feeds, forage crops, and crop residues.
                      The difference between total feed requirement and total cropped feed supply is taken to equal the demand for grazing land.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      The grazing land section of NFA 2019 relies on the methodology and data proposed by Haberl et al. (2007) for calculating
                      human appropriation of net primary production (NPP). The calculation starts with the number of livestock in a country and
                      their feed requirements. These feed requirements are partially filled through market feed (crops grown specifically to be fed to animals),
                      residues (crop scraps that can be fed to livestock but not to humans), and cropped grasses (grasses that are grown on cropland and cut specifically
                      to be fed to livestock). Once the feed demand satisfied by the above sources has been accounted for, the remaining amount of feed required is assumed
                      to be provided by grazing land. The amount of grazing land required is based on dividing the grass feed required by the average grass yield of rangeland.

                      </br>
                      The Fishing Grounds Footprint is calculated by dividing the amount of primary production consumed by an aquatic species over its
                      lifetime by an estimate of the harvestable primary production per hectare of marine area. This harvestable primary production
                      is based on a global estimate of the sustainable catch of several aquatic species (Pauly and Christensen, 1995). These sustainable
                      catch figures are converted into primary production equivalents, and divided by the total area of continental shelf. This same calculation
                      is currently used for inland fish as well.

                Biocapacity refers to the amount of biologically productive land and water areas available within the boundaries of a given country.
                Biocapacity is calculated for each of the five major land use types: cropland, grazing land, fishing grounds (marine and inland waters),
                forest, and built-up land. Built-up land biocapacity is included here because, though built-up land does not generate resources, buildings and
                infrastructure occupy the biocapacity of the land they cover. The carbon Footprint does not have corresponding biocapacity because NFA 2019 assumes
                all carbon uptake as a demand on forest land biocapacity. Therefore, including carbon dioxide biocapacity in addition to forest land biocapacity
                would lead to double counting.
            </br>
            </br>
                <strong>Yield factors</strong> reflect the relative productivity of national and world average hectares of a given land use type. Each country,
                in each year, has a yield factor for each land use type. Yield factors are used in biocapacity calculations when biocapacity is reported in global hectares.

                        <strong>Equivalence factors</strong> reflect the relative productivity of world average hectares of different land use types.
                        Equivalence factors are the same for all countries, and change slightly from year to year. Equivalence factors are calculated in
                        a satellite workbook to the NFA 2019 which is available upon request.

                        Equivalence factors are calculated using suitability indexes from the Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) model, combined
                        with information about actual areas of cropland, forest, and grazing area from FAOSTAT (Global Agro-Ecological Zones 2000; FAO
                        ResourceSTAT Statistical Database). The GAEZ model divides all land globally into five categories, each of which is assigned a suitability score:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Very Suitable (VS): 0.9</li>

                            <li>Moderately Suitable (MS): 0.5</li>
                            <li>Marginally Suitable (mS): 0.3</li>
                            <li>Not Suitable (NS): 0.1</li>

                The equivalence factor calculation assumes that the most productive land is put to its most productive use. The calculations assume that the most suitable land
                available will be planted to cropland, the next most suitable land will be under forest, and the least suitable land will be grazing area.
                The equivalence factor is calculated as the ratio of the average suitability index for a given land use type divided by the average suitability index for all land use types.
                </br>
                </br>
                The equivalence factor for built up area is set equal to the equivalence factor for cropland, reflecting the assumption that built up areas occupy former cropland.

                </br>
                The equivalence factor for marine area is calculated such that a single global hectare of pasture will produce an amount of calories of beef equal to the
                amount of calories of salmon that can be produced on a single global hectare of marine area. The equivalence factor for inland water is set equal to the
                equivalence factor for marine area.

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>Humanity’s total <strong>Ecological Footprint</strong> has been increasing steadily at an average of 2.1 percent per year (SD = 1.9)
                since 1961, nearly tripling from 7.0 billion gha in 1961 to 20.6 billion gha in 2014. The increase in Ecological Footprint
                has been <strong>outpacing biocapacity</strong> increases, which have increased at an average of 0.5 percent per year (SD = 0.7),
                from 9.6 billion gha in 1961 to 12.2 billion gha in 2014. Together, these results indicate that Earth’s ecological overshoot
                began in the 1970s; further, ecological overshoot continues to grow at an average rate of 2.0 percent (SD = 2.3) per year.
                In 2014, humanity’s Ecological Footprint was 69.6 percent greater than Earth’s biocapacity.

                        During the same period, <strong>per capita Ecological Footprint</strong> increased by 24 percent (2.29 to 2.84 gha per person),
                        while <strong>per capita biocapacity</strong> decreased by 46 percent (3.13 to 1.68 gha per person). The increase in total
                        biocapacity and decrease in per capita biocapacity are indicative of a growing global population. More recently, the world
                        Ecological Footprint per person decreased by 1.1 percent between 2010 and 2014, while biocapacity per person decreased by 2.4
                        percent over the same time period. In other words, although our individual share of the world’s biocapacity is decreasing, we are
                        also reducing our individual demand on nature.

                        The <strong>carbon footprint</strong> is the fastest growing Footprint component; in 2014, it comprised 60 percent of the world’s
                        total Ecological Footprint. This is a significant increase from the carbon Footprint in 1961, which contributed to 44 percent of
                        the world’s Ecological Footprint, or 150 years ago, when it was less than one percent of what it is today.
                        <strong>Cropland footprint</strong> was the next largest contributor to the world’s Ecological Footprint in 2014, at 19.4 percent, followed by
                        <strong>forest-product</strong> (9.8 percent), <strong>grazing-land</strong> (5.1 percent), <strong>fishing-ground</strong> (3.3 percent),
                        and <strong>built-up-land</strong> (2.3 percent).

                        Across <strong>individual countries</strong>, results show that most countries run a biocapacity deficit,
                        where they have larger Ecological Footprints than biocapacity. Countries that continue to have biocapacity
                        reserves (where the biocapacity within a country’s borders is greater than the Ecological Footprint
                        of that country) tend to be located in forested regions, such as the tropics and boreal latitudes.

                        National progress towards sustainable development can be assessed by comparing the NFA results to the United Nations'
                        <strong>Human Development Index (HDI)</strong>, which aggregates education, longevity, and income into a single metric.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) defines an <strong>HDI score of 0.7 as the threshold for high development</strong>.
                        The <strong>biocapacity available on the planet is calculated as 1.7 gha per person</strong>. Combining these two thresholds gives
                        clear minimum conditions for globally sustainable human development. Countries in the light-blue section of the lower right-hand
                        box exhibit high levels of development with globally replicable resource demand.
                        As of 2014, only two countries fit these criteria: Sri Lanka and the Dominican Republic. On average, the world is moving closer
                        to the Global Sustainable Development Quadrant: HDI has increased consistently since the metric was developed in 1990, from 0.55 in
                        1990 to 0.69 in 2014 (weighted by the population of each country). In addition, the world’s Ecological Footprint per person decreased from
                        slightly from 2013 to 2014. However, the current world Ecological Footprint of 2.8 gha per person remains far above the 1.7 gha of
                        biocapacity available to each person.
