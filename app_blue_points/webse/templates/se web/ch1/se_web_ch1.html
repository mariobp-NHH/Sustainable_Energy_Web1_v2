            <h2>Green Economy</h2>
            <p class="text-right">
            The term ”green economy” is based on multiple conceptual
            grounds. In fact green economy as a concept has evolved
            from, and been influenced by, many different schools of
            economic thought. This section provides a brief overview of
            how the concept has evolved.
            </br>
            </br>
            The green economy concept is not new, but it became popular
            outside of academic circles right after the 2008-2009 global
            financial crisis.
            </br>
            </br>
            The economic downturn that followed encouraged numerous
            pledges to reform current economic systems towards a path
            much less damaging to society, the environment and the
            financial system itself.
            As a result, numerous countries
            implemented green economy stimulus packages to reinvigorate
            production and consumption, particularly in the
            short term. At the time, the available definition of green
            economy was provided by UN Environmental Program. In its simplest expression,
            UN Environmental Program has argued that <strong> “a green economy is low-carbon,
                resource efficient and socially inclusive”</strong>.
            </p>
            <h5>The term "green economy" is based on multiple conceptual grounds:</h5>

                <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
                  <div class="fw-bold">Agricultural economics.</div>
                  <p class="text-right">This was done
                    during the so-called ”Green Revolution” in agriculture that
                    occurred between 1940 and 1970.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    At that time, agricultural
                    economists were studying and analysing the issues that the
                    ”Green Revolution” brought to this economic sector, and
                    they used the term green economy to refer to the positive
                      impacts that <strong>research and technology</strong> development had on
                      agricultural productivity.</p>

                  <div class="fw-bold">Welfare economics.</div>
                  <p class="text-right">This school
                    of economics is concerned with the effects of economic
                    activities on welfare or well-being.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    From a general point of view, welfare or well-being is often understood as the state
                    of being healthy, happy, or prosperous; either as individuals
                    or as a group.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Welfare economics also provides the basis
                      for the <strong>”market failure”</strong> concept, which can be simply
                    understood as the idea that if incorrect price signals are sent,
                    market economies fail to achieve efficiency.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Another aspect that is also captured by both welfare economics and the term
                      green economy is <strong>economic inequality</strong>, that is, the uneven
                      distribution of income and wealth.</p>
                </div>
              </li>

                <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
                  <div class="fw-bold">Natural resource economics.</div>
                    <p class="text-right">This school of economics deals basically with the supply,
                    demand, and distribution of renewable and depletable
                    resources.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    A key objective for natural resources economics is
                        to find ways <strong>to manage resources efficiently and sustainably</strong>
                    so that they are available to future generations. In principle,
                    a green economy should guarantee the capacity of natural
                    capital that provides resources and environmental services
                        in the long run.</p>
                </div>
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
                <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
                  <div class="fw-bold">Environmental economics.</div>
                    <p class="text-right">For environmental economists pollution is understood as a <strong>negative externality</strong>, take air pollution for example.
                    If an economic activity is reducing air quality, the health
                    or welfare of a third party may suffer as a consequence.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Environmental economists attribute this to the absence of
                    prices for environmental assets like clean air, biodiversity and
                    clean water.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Relying on the idea of sustainable development and also on
                    the theory, the methods and the policy options provided
                    by environmental and natural resource economics, Pearce,
                    Markandya and Barbier framed the term green economy in the
                    late 1990s around <strong>technology innovation, resource efficiency
                            natural capital, ecological risks and human development</strong>.</p>

                    distribution and consumption. Lately, there has been

                    included in the green economy term have also been put

                    </br>
                    There is a growing body of
                    knowledge that shows the rapid loss of ecosystems services.
                    This situation has encouraged investment in and conservation
                    of natural capital, which is also a critical aspect for the
                    modern interpretation of the term green economy.

                    Conventional or neoclassical economics, according
                    to ecological economists, does not reflect adequately the value of essential factors such as
                    clean air and water, species diversity, or social and
                    generational equity. To address this, ecological
                      economists advocate a transdisciplinary approach.</p>

            <h2>Sustainable energy</h2>
            <p>Sustainable energy is energy produced and used in such a way that it "meets the needs of the present
            without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." (Kutscher, 2019).
            It is similar to the concepts of green energy and clean energy in its consideration of environmental impacts,
            however formal definitions of sustainable energy also include economic and social impacts.
            </br>
            </br>

            We will study the concept of sustainable energy and we will study the relation between <strong>sustainable energy</strong>
            and <strong>sustainable development</strong> in chapter 3.</p>
