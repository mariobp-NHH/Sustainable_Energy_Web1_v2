                    <p class="mb-1">
                        The first Human Development Index (HDI) report, published 30 years ago, presented the concept and measurement of
                        <strong>human development</strong>. Since then, the connection between the Gross domestic product (GDP)
                        and the HDI has evolved, and proposals have been made to adjust or change human development metrics,
                        including to <strong>account for sustainability</strong>.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        In this chapter, we look at the new reality underpinning proposals for the Anthropocene and what that means for human
                        development. We propose arguments for reimagining the human development journey as one in which people are embedded
                        in the <strong>biosphere</strong>. We also explores <strong>new metrics</strong> for measuring human development taking into account
                        our impact in the planet.

            <h2>Renewing human development for the Anthropocene</h2>

            <p>
                The <strong>Anthropocene</strong>: the age of humans. For the first time in our history the most serious and immediate,
                even existential, risks are human made and unfolding at planetary scale. This section argues that this new reality
                calls for reimagining the human development journey and leveraging the human development approach to support transformational
                social changes to ease pressures on the planet. We study the evolution of the Human Development Index during
                the last thirty years, and how to frame it in the context of the Anthropocene.

                <p><strong>The Anthropocene</strong> is a proposed geological epoch dating from the commencement of significant human impact on
                    Earth's geology and ecosystems, including, but not limited to, anthropogenic climate change.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    As of July 2020, neither the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) nor the International Union of
                    Geological Sciences (IUGS) has officially approved the term as a recognised subdivision of geologic time,
                    although the Anthropocene Working Group (AWG) of the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) of
                    the ICS voted in April 2016 to proceed towards a formal golden spike (GSSP) proposal to define the Anthropocene
                    epoch in the geologic time scale and presented the recommendation to the International Geological Congress in August 2016.
                    In May 2019, the AWG voted in favour of submitting a formal proposal to the ICS by 2021, locating potential stratigraphic markers
                    to the mid-twentieth century of the common era. This time period coincides with the start of the Great Acceleration,
                    a post-WWII time period during which socioeconomic and Earth system trends increase at a dramatic rate, and the Atomic Age.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Various start dates for the Anthropocene have been proposed, ranging from the beginning of the Agricultural Revolution
                    12,000–15,000 years ago, to as recent as the 1960s. The ratification process is still ongoing, and thus a date remains
                    to be decided definitively, but the peak in radionuclides fallout consequential to atomic bomb testing during the 1950s has
                    been more favoured than others, locating a possible beginning of the Anthropocene to the detonation of the first atomic bomb in
                    1945, or the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963.

            <h3>Enter the Anthropo</h3>

            <p>
                <i>“The world is a complex, nonlinear system, in which the living and non-living components are tightly coupled
                    with important tipping points.” Timothy M. Lenton (Lenton, 2019)</i>
                </br>
                </br>
                The story of the planet over time is told in the Geological Time Scale. It records distinct periods in the Earth’s history
                over timescales spanning thousands to millions of years, differentiated by characteristics ranging from climate to the
                emergence of life and stages in its evolution. Earth system scientists introduced the term Anthropocene at the turn of
                the 21st century. They confronted a range of observations of recent changes to the planet that contrasted with the palaeoenvironmental
                record of the Holocene (which is estimated to have started about 11,700 years ago) and indicated that the planet was
                operating in a no analogue state—that is, without precedent in the history of the planet.
                </br>
                </br>
                The Anthropocene is not yet formally established as a new geological epoch, but several geologists and Earth system scientists
                propose dating its beginning to the mid-20th century with the growth in new anthropogenic materials as part of the evidence be hind
                their proposal. That would correspond to the Great Acceleration of human pressures on the planet that have the potential to leave a
                geological imprint (Figure: Beginning of the Anthropocene).
                </br>
                </br>
                Drawing on interdisciplinary evidence and analysis, Earth systems science, geology and ecology characterize the Anthropocene from distinct perspectives
                (Figure: Perspectives from the natural sciences on the Anthropocene). Each brings something different, showing that considering diverse perspectives and approaches reveals the complexity and reach of the concept.

            <h3>Understanding geological and ecological change</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>To specify the Anthropocene as a new geological epoch, geologists must identify a contemporary human-induced change that is significant and
                detectable over the timescales of Earth’s history</strong>. Mining, landfills, construction and urbanization have resulted in the greatest expansion
                of new minerals that do not exist in the natural world as rocks (in the geological sense of having the potential for long-term persistence).
                Pure elemental aluminium is one of these materials, and as much as 98 percent of the aluminium on Earth has been produced since 1950. Another
                is plastics, whose current annual production equals the global human biomass. The disruptions of the global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and
                nitrogen also leave detectable signals visible in ice cores, reflecting rapid increases in the concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane.
                A unique and globally dispersed geological signature corresponds to the radioactive fallout from <strong>atmospheric nuclear weapons</strong>
                tested in the mid-20th century.
                </br>
                </br>
                Geologists also consider <strong>changes in flora and fauna</strong>, both extinctions and the mixing of species across previously
                isolated continents and islands. Changes in periods in the geological timescale are often linked to sudden changes in the fossil record.
                While difficult to use as a marker for the Anthropocene with the precision of radionuclides, the magnitude and scale of the changes by humans
                to life on Earth may be the most enduring and obvious over the long term.
                </br>
                </br>
                While Earth system science emphasizes the role of the biosphere on planetary functions and geologists look for markers,
                <strong>ecologists and sustainability scientists</strong> provide additional insights on human pressures by considering other
                fundamental changes to the diversity of life on the planet. <strong>The Anthropocene biosphere corresponds to a third and
                fundamentally new stage in the evolution of life on Earth</strong>. The first was dominated by simple single-cell microbial organisms
                —from approximately 3.5 billion to 650 million years ago. In the second stage complex multicellular life emerged,
                becoming widespread and diverse after the Cambrian explosion 540 million years ago. <strong>Four characteristics make the
                Anthropocene biosphere unlike anything that has ever existed on the planet</strong>:
                <ol>
                    <li>Homogenization of flora and fauna through deliberate or accidental transfer of species across the globe.</li>
                    <li>One species (humans) consuming 25–40 percent of land net primary productivity (that is, the biomass and energy made available by plants to all life on Earth).</li>
                    <li>Human-directed evolution of plants and animals, marginalizing natural biomass—something unprecedented in the last 2.4 billion years.</li>
                    <li>Increasing impact of new technologies as the biosphere interacts with the technosphere</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h3>Bringing the Anthro into the Anthropocene</h3>

            <p>
                Along with the physical evidence this added dimension of the Anthropocene is essential to framing a new human development narrative.
                It places people’s interactions with nature in historical, social and economic contexts, informed by insights from the natural sciences.
                This is reflected in new fields such as the climate-economy literature and in the resurgence of interest in environmental history.
                </br>
                </br>
                Historical analysis places the current moment of the Anthropocene in perspective but also shows how much of human history has been influenced by
                occurrences in the natural world. In the words of historian Kristina Sessa, “The idea that objects, animals, and other non-human
                entities (volcanoes, oak trees and solar radiation, for instance) shape the development of human affairs, that they possess historical
                agency in some form, has forced scholars to<strong> rethink</strong> some of their basic assumptions about <strong>government</strong>, <strong>power</strong>,
                and <strong>culture</strong>.” (Sessa, 2019)
                </br>
                </br>
                Thus, many argue that rather than looking at the Anthropocene as a precisely dated geological period, it would be better to consider it a
                process, or a continuous Holocene/Anthropocene, in order to understand the long (and ongoing) transition of the dialectical
                relationship between cultural, political and economic systems and the natural world. Others reject the notion altogether, criticizing
                a narrative that lumps humanity together without attending to either existing inequalities or historical asymmetries in power and
                overexploitation of resources. One common line of criticism is that the notion of the Anthropocene, especially the more science-based formulations
                such as planetary boundaries, do not strike at the heart of the problem, which is seen as capitalist modes of production as well as
                longstanding historical legacies of colonization. Although Edward Barbier documents that the environmental record of centrally
                planned and collectivized economies has been no better than that of capitalist ones.
                </br>
                </br>
                Some of these differences in perspective reflect differences between the social sciences and the humanities, on the one hand, and the natural sciences,
                on the other. The humanities see society and the economy as complex systems, with nature at best a contextual backdrop or something that
                can be analytically separated from societies, even if they are physically interdependent. The natural sciences take the reverse perspective,
                with natural systems as interdependent and complex and human agency described in aggregate terms as causing generalized impacts or disturbances.
                Others oppose conceptualizing the Anthropocene as a process because they view the concept’s power as signifying a rupture with the past,
                thus indicating a contemporary state of the world that urgently needs fundamental changes at the risk of catastrophic consequences for nature.

                <strong>Where does this leave us?</strong> With the <strong>notion that the Anthropocene is something novel in two ways</strong>.

                          The Anthropocene is an encapsulation of the concept that modern human activity is large relative to planetary processes,
                          and therefore that human social, economic, and political decisions have become entangled in a web of planetary feedbacks.
                          This global planetary entanglement is something new in human history and Earth history.

                          The Anthropocene is a catalyst for systematic thinking about the interdependence of people and nature, including the
                          Earth system. It is informed by a diversity of disciplines, going beyond linear and simplified narratives of progress,
                          and invites framing the options that face us today as more than a choice between impending catastrophe or an easy
                          decoupling of economic activity from planetary pressures.

            <p>
                One implication of this understanding of the relationship between people and nature is the recent reframing of the conceptual approach of ecosystems as
                providers of services to acknowledge nature’s contributions to people. This reframing also presents anthropogenic drivers of changes in
                nature as being embedded in institutions and governance systems. It recognizes the intrinsic value of preserving nature.

            <h2>Socioeconomic implications of the Anthropocene</h2>

            <p>
                We study the implications that the Antrophocene has on our way of framing the economic system and its relation with nature.
            </p>

            <h3>Confronting a new reality: People versus trees?</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Our dependence on nature is not in question</strong>. Amartya Sen put it bluntly: “It is not so much that humanity
                is trying to sustain the natural world, but rather that humanity is trying to sustain itself. It is
                us that will have to ‘go’ unless we can put the world around us in reasonable order. The precariousness of nature is our peril,
                our fragility.” But there are <strong>two new elements to consider</strong>.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>First, the notion of the Anthropocene has forced a <strong>reframing of thinking</strong> from standalone environmental and sustainability
                    issues, such as climate change, to the recognition of a set of interdependent challenges resulting from underlying processes of
                    planetary change driven by human pressures.
	                </br>
                    </br>
                    As Sharachchandra Lele put it, we need to move beyond a “narrowed framing of the problem: <strong>one value</strong> (sustaining future generations),
                    <strong>one problem</strong> (climate change), <strong>one goal</strong> (reduce carbon emissions) and <strong>one solution</strong> (renewables).”
                    And that calls for a full understanding of the pressures we are putting on the planet and of our interdependence with nature.</li>
                </br>
                <li>Second, the notion of the Anthropocene emerges thanks to remarkable advances in <strong>Earth system and sustainability sciences</strong>.
                    In addition to documenting and explaining the impacts of human activities, these new fields are stimulating interdisciplinary
                    work, encompassing natural and social sciences and the humanities, providing insights into how to mitigate those impacts
                    while improving people’s lives.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                A key insight emerging from this vast and rapidly growing body of work is that <strong>social and natural systems are best seen not
                only as interacting and interdependent but also as embedded in each other</strong>. Moving beyond the notion of sustainable development
                as separable human development targets constrained by environmental or natural resource limits, to an inseparable socio-ecological systems
                perspective on sustainable development, offers a fresh perspective on sustainable development. It further offers a novel and expanded opportunity
                space from which to address the challenges of the Anthropocene.

                  <p class="text-right">
                      First, it presents a challenge as to how to imagine and pursue human development. Addressing social imbalances,
                      the hemisphere on the right in figure (Planetary and social imbalances reinforce each other), has always been at the core of the human development
                      journey. But until now the other hemisphere, planetary imbalances, has not been systematically brought into the human development journey.
                  </p>

              </li>

                <div class="ms-2 me-auto">

                      Second, the human development approach has not yet been fully leveraged to inform how to address the challenges in the hemisphere on the
                      left in figure (Planetary and social imbalances reinforce each other). It can offer fresh perspectives on making expanded capabilities and human agency central to easing pressures
                      on the planet.

                        <strong>Human societies are embedded in the biosphere and depend on it</strong>. But by extracting from it for economic activities that shape consumption
                        and production patterns, they have also been depleting it. Much of this happens in the background and seems invisible to social and
                        individual choices, similar to forgetting our dependence on the air we breathe. To make the interactions between social and ecological
                        systems more visible, it is useful to look at material and energy flows in our societies and their impact on planetary processes (figure

            <h3>Beyond needs, beyond sustaining</h3>

            <p>
                The Brundtland approach to defining <strong>sustainable development</strong> as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the
                ability of future generations to meet their own needs” was a watershed moment (WCED, 1987). It brought together the ethical imperative of
                fulfilling the basic subsistence requirements of people today—putting poverty eradication squarely at the centre of the concept—with an obligation
                to our descendants rooted in <strong>intergenerational justice</strong>. It put people at the core, instead of defining what needed to be sustained
                for consumption or production. And rather than asking for the preservation of a pristine state of nature, it emphasized the ability of each
                generation to use resources, allowing for some fungibility across resources.
                </br>
                </br>
                Where to go <strong>beyond needs</strong>? What can we expand, beyond focusing on sustaining? How to account for persistent inequalities that
                feeds social imbalances? The human development approach offers a path to address these questions.
                </br>
                </br>
                Human development takes us beyond notions of sustainability based on needs fulfilment and away from notions based on instrumental objectives such
                as consumption or economic activity (measured by growth in GDP, for instance).
                </br>
                </br>
                A focus on <strong>needs</strong> may lead to prioritizing social or economic floors, providing a minimum foundation to be shared by everyone, but it does not fully account for inequalities, and it downplays the potential of
                people as agents.
                </br>
                </br>
                There may not be a clear blueprint of what human development is and will be in the decades to come. Human development is permanently under construction,
                and the approach is open to new and emerging challenges and opportunities. This section has attempted to sketch a vision of the <strong>human development
                journey in the Anthropocene</strong> in order to navigate towards a better planet for people and the rest of life.

                    <strong>Brundtland Commission.</strong> Formerly known as the<strong> World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED)</strong>, the mission of the Brundtland
                    Commission is to unite countries to pursue <strong>sustainable development</strong> together. The Chairperson of the Commission, Gro Harlem Brundtland,
                    was appointed by United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar in December 1983. At the time, the UN General Assembly realized that
                    there was a heavy deterioration of the human environment and natural resources. To rally countries to work and pursue sustainable development
                    together, the UN decided to establish the Brundtland Commission. Gro Harlem Brundtland was the former Prime Minister of Norway and was chosen due
                    to her strong background in the sciences and public health. The Brundtland Commission officially dissolved in December 1987 after releasing Our Common
                    Future, also known as the Brundtland Report, in October 1987.

                        Over the past 2.6 million years the planet’s temperature has oscillated sharply, leading to alternating warmer and colder periods. But the
                        Holocene has been both warmer and more stable in temperature. The climate system has also been more stable,
                        despite massive hydrological variability that has had radical implications at the regional scale. For instance,
                        the Sahara has not always been the dry desert we see today, and the Amazon had to confront severe droughts earlier in the Holocene.
                        In fact, an important characteristic of the climate system during the Holocene is the tight link between the whole web of life on
                        the planet and in the atmosphere, regulating the carbon cycle. For instance, about a fifth of annual average precipitation
                        falling on land is linked to plant-regulated water cycles, with many places now receiving half the precipitation from this type
                        of cycle that they received before.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        A prominent framework to summarize how changes in the Earth system and the biosphere underpin human prosperity in
                        fundamental ways is the<strong> planetary boundaries approach</strong> (Figure: Planetary boundaries).
                        In 2009 Johan Rockström and colleagues identified what they denoted a <strong>safe operating space for humanity</strong>.
                        This space is defined by several Earth system boundaries that, if transgressed, could undermine life-supporting conditions
                        on our planet. This notion, refined over the years, remains one of the most influential framings for the challenges of the
                        Anthropocene. Though the framework was designed explicitly for the <strong>global level</strong> only, there have been attempts
                        to apply it at <strong>lower scales</strong>, even though that is neither encouraged nor supported by the original proponents.

                    <u>Planetary boundaries.</u>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    <strong>Planetary boundaries</strong> is a concept involving Earth system processes that contain environmental boundaries.
                    It was proposed in 2009 by a group of Earth system and environmental scientists, led by Johan Rockström from the Stockholm
                    Resilience Centre and Will Steffen from the Australian National University. The group wanted to define a "safe operating
                    space for humanity" for the international community, including governments at all levels, international organizations,
                    civil society, the scientific community and the private sector, as a precondition for sustainable development. The framework
                    is based on scientific evidence that human actions since the Industrial Revolution have become the main driver of global environmental
                    change.
                    </br>
                    </br>
			        According to the paradigm, "transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to
                    the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental-scale to
                    planetary-scale systems." The Earth system process boundaries mark the safe zone for the planet to the extent that they
                    are not crossed. As of 2009, two boundaries have already been crossed, while others are in imminent danger of being crossed.

                    </br>
			        The Doughnut, or Doughnut economics, is a visual framework for sustainable development – shaped like a doughnut or lifebelt –
                    combining the concept of planetary boundaries with the complementary concept of social boundaries. The name derives from the
                    shape of the diagram, i.e. a disc with a hole in the middle. The centre hole of the model depicts the proportion of people that
                    lack access to life's essentials (healthcare, education, equity and so on) while the crust represents the ecological ceilings (planetary boundaries)
                    that life depends on and must not be overshot. The diagram was developed by Oxford economist Kate Raworth in the Oxfam paper
                    A Safe and Just Space for Humanity and elaborated upon in her book Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist.

            <p>
                Human development is dynamic. So the way we measure it must be, too. Over the years,
                new dashboards and indices have been introduced. How do we measure human development in the Anthropocene?

                In line with a central theme of this chapter, there is no one-size-fits-all tool or metric. Instead, this section introduces

                    Confronting the Anthropocene calls for a <strong>new generation of human development metrics</strong>. The Human Development Index (HDI)
                    introduced in 1990 was intended to be a general index for global assessment and critique based on a minimal listing of capabilities
                    focused on enjoying a basic quality of life. Clear and simple, and focused on <strong>income</strong>,<strong> education</strong> and <strong>health</strong>,
                    it shaped public and political debate and reoriented objectives and actions. It has since been augmented by the <strong>Inequality-adjusted HDI</strong>,
                    the <strong>Gender Development Index</strong>, the <strong>Gender Inequality Index</strong> and the <strong>Multidimensional Poverty Index</strong>.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    The inclusion of <strong>income</strong> in the HDI was intended only as <strong>a proxy for capabilities</strong> other than <strong>education</strong> and <strong>health</strong>,
                    as something instrumentally important for achievements in those other capabilities. But gross national income (GNI) does not account for
                    <strong>planetary pressures</strong>. So this section considers possible <strong>adjustments to the HDI’s income component</strong>, subtracting the
                    <strong>social costs of carbon</strong> from GNI and discussing options to account for changes in total wealth that include <strong>natural capital</strong>.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    The section also presents an adjustment to the HDI that uses indicators of <strong>greenhouse gas emissions</strong> and <strong>material footprint</strong>.
                    The adjustment is made by multiplying the HDI by an<strong> adjustment factor</strong> that <strong>accounts for planetary pressures</strong>.
                    This adjustment factor is calculated as the arithmetic mean of indices measuring carbon dioxide emissions per capita—which speaks to
                    the challenge of shifting away from fossil fuels for energy—and the material footprint per capita—which relates to the challenge of closing
                    material cycles. <strong>This Planetary pressures–adjusted HDI provides a sense of the possibilities for achieving high HDI values with lower
                    emissions and resource use</strong>.

        <h3>The income component and planetary pressures</h3>

            <p>
                This section builds on proposals to add environmental and sustainability dimensions to the HDI  but explores <strong>metrics</strong> guided by the
                importance of going beyond sustaining. It focuses on the implications of accounting for planetary pressures by adjusting the income component
                of the HDI.

                  <p class="text-right">
                      The HDI’s indicator for the income dimension is Gross National Income (GNI). “Gross” is the rogue word in this concept be cause it fails to account for
                      the depreciation of capital assets  and ignores <strong>natural capital</strong> and the <strong>social costs</strong> (borne by everyone) of
                      environmental damage. <strong>Other income-based indicators</strong> take a broader view of net flows from capital and adjust for natural resource
                      depletion and damage from emissions and pollution. Here we explore <strong>a simpler and more direct adjustment to GNI by subtracting the social
                      costs of carbon dioxide emissions</strong>. Again, this is driven by the importance of encouraging a transformation in energy use to lower greenhouse gas
                      emissions. This is not meant to accurately capture the full social costs of environmental damage or the overuse of resources not in GNI.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      The social cost of carbon is the economic cost attributable to an additional tonne of carbon dioxide emissions or its equivalent.
                      Estimates of this cost depend on several assumptions and parameter choices and span a wide range. The UNDP (2020) consider <strong>two estimates</strong>:

                      <ul>
                        <li>One proposed by the <strong>International Monetary Fund </strong>sets the cost of carbon in 2030 at $75 per
                            tonne of carbon dioxide—in 2017 US dollars and covering all fossil fuels. It is based on a model showing that the impact of a global carbon t
                            ax at this level would be consistent with countries meeting their Paris Agreement pledges.
                        </li>
                        <li>The other estimate is from a recent application of the <strong>Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy integrated assessment model</strong>.
                            It includes the latest climate science and reflects a broad range of expert recommendations on social discount rates a
                            key parameter in the model that weighs the value today of future benefits and costs. The median expert view on discount
                            rates gives a carbon social cost of around $200 per tonne of carbon dioxide in 2020 (in 2010 international dollars).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-right">
                      The ecological footprint measures the amount of material extracted (biomass, fossil fuels, metal-ores (minerals) and nonmetal-ores)
                      to meet domestic final demand for goods and services, regardless of where extraction occurs. It is a consumption-based measure that
                      <strong>accounts for international trade</strong>. It also indicates <strong>pressures on the biosphere</strong> exerted by socioeconomic
                      activities, since it includes the use of biomass—thus indirectly reflecting impacts of actions such as land use change on the loss of biosphere integrity.

            </br>
            <p>
                The adjustment corresponds to multiplying the HDI by an adjustment factor, creating the Planetary pressures–adjusted HDI (PHDI)
                (Figure: Planetary Human Development Index). If a country puts no pressure on the planet, its PHDI and HDI would be equal, but the PHDI falls below the
                HDI as pressure rises. The <strong>adjustment factor</strong> is calculated as the arithmetic mean of indices measuring <strong>carbon dioxide emissions per capita</strong>,
                which speaks to the energy transition away from fossil fuels, and<strong> material footprint per capita</strong>, which relates to closing material cycles

            <h2>Human development progress based on the Planetary pressures–adjusted Human Development Index: A new lens</h2>

            <p>
                The global PHDI offers a summary view of the evolution in human development and the associated planetary
                pressures—the world has consistently increased planetary pressures per capita over the past three decades.
                The PHDI is not only lower than the HDI; it is also
                growing more slowly. The gap between the conventional assessment of development
                (the HDI) and the new perspective to navigate the Anthropocene (the experimental PHDI) has been widening.

            </p>

            <p>
                In figure (Planetary pressures vs HDI) the horizontal axis shows the HDI, and the vertical axis shows the index of
                planetary pressures (which is one minus the adjustment factor for planetary pressures that is multiplied by the HDI to generate
                the PHDI). Also plotted are contour lines corresponding to the same PHDI values that result from different combinations of the
                HDI and the index of planetary pressures (isoquants). PHDI values increase as these lines move towards the bottom right corner.
                This corner (highlighted in green in the figure) is the aspirational destination of the human development journey in the Anthropocene.
                </br>
                </br>
                For instance, countries in positions A and B have very different HDI values (0.55 and 0.85) but the same PHDI value (0.55) because
                the greater progress in HDI in country B has been coupled with much greater planetary pressures. This simple example shows the importance of a joint
                assessment of socioeconomic and planetary pressure indicators as part of a single framework.
                </br>
                </br>
                Looking at the trajectory of countries over the past three decades shows different paths across human development groups. Low and medium human
                development countries have been able to improve social and economic conditions substantially without a high burden
                on planetary pressures. But in high and very high human development countries, improvements on the HDI have been coupled with rising planetary pressures.
                </br>
                </br>
                Although absolute planetary pressures have been growing, <strong>two aspects reflect some progress</strong>:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        After the 2008 global financial crisis a few developed countries have shown some <strong>decoupling of human development gains from planetary pressures</strong>.
                        For instance, on average, the top 10 countries on the PHDI have increased their HDI value and reduced their planetary pressures over the last decade
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is some evidence <strong>more broadly of relative decoupling</strong>. The curve corresponding to the average performance on the HDI and planetary pressures for all
                        countries moved slightly towards the bottom right-hand corner between 1990 and 2019 (Figure: Planetary pressures vs HDI, trends).
                    </li>
